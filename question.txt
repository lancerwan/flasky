Now,I have already completed the basic work,but I'm still in trouble.
Seen from outside, I added inputs for the user to select currency,but I am disappionted to find that my input had nothing influence to HTML.I don't know.
In addition, I can't choose city that want to input.
Temperature display also have some problems.
I change request.form.get to request.args.get and success to choose my arguements.But this method doesn't work for weather.Then I found that is a question of app_url.
git push 
over
now I change git username
